Collective Leverage
Tokenization of Companies & Brands

The world makes more sense when there are minds thinking about progress and ethical banking; 
today, everything is possible thanks to blockchain and web3. Our purpose is to help build the greatest culture of all time, that of collective leverage.


introduction:
GM Holding drives the economy of Latin America through the tokenization of traditional companies and brands. 
We collaborate to cultivate a culture of collective leverage, democratizing investment and creating inclusive prosperity. 
Our vision is to activate economic potential, build thriving communities, and foster shared abundance worldwide.

About Us:
Our company was founded in 2016 with the purpose of impacting communities that have never had access to the economy or the best opportunities. 
Over time, we found in blockchain technology the capacity and virtues necessary to develop a methodology that provides order and economic justice, 
returning economic power to productive companies in countries. We aim to enable people worldwide to become liquidity aggregators in real 
businesses and traditional sectors such as construction, mining, hospitality, logistics, import-export, and franchises. We are focused on a broad niche, 
which is the B2B, B2B2C, B2C hybrid achieved in different departments that make up the Holding.

problems:
In Latin America, there are more than 19 million companies in industrial and commercial sectors that struggle with access to 
liquidity for their operations. Even obtaining loans or investors is a costly and time-consuming endeavor.

Problem 1: The companies relinquish their governance in exchange for money.
Problem 2: Banks demand too many requirements to lend money to entrepreneurs.
Problem 3: Lenders charge high percentages, and entrepreneurs often end up bankrupt.
Problem 4: Entrepreneurs today have two options: focus on seeking working capital or concentrate on economic activities.


solutions:
Tokenization is a solution to all these limitations; applying technology in favor of companies and productive sectors in 
developing countries is a great option for both businesses and investors worldwide.

Solution 1: Developing Security Tokens to represent the company in the crypto market.
Solution 2: Establishing legal and tax responsibilities for the productive tokens of companies.
Solution 3: Parameterizing the token economy with rules in a DAPP using Smart Contracts.
Solution 4: Launching secure participation offerings on the blockchain to provide backing for investors.


GM Holding Companies:

1. GM LABS: Incubator for Businesses Prior to Tokenization
2. TOKENIZA: Tokenization Agency: Designing and Developing Smart Contracts for Companies
3. GM FINANCE: Web3 Stock Exchange: Users worldwide can discover company tokens, rank, and rate their digital economic activities.
4. GM BANK: Mutual Savings and Credit Solidarity Association, the solidarity Fintech of the business group supervised by Supersolidaria in Colombia.
5. ZERO THERMAL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LLC: American Company with a Biopreferred Master Patent for environmentally-friendly polymer solutions.

20+ Companies in the process of tokenization.
In 2024, we project to tokenize 100 companies and launch them into the market through our DAPP GM FINANCE


UTILITY Token DATA 2023:
Our GM Holding token (GM) has been listed on CoinMarketCap since 2020, providing us with valuable experiences that helped shape our tokenization methodology. 
Of the 200,000,000 tokens, 45% have been added to the market among 929 holders. 
The remaining tokens will be added through Uniswap on the ERC20 network.

BEP20: 0xd523f5097fe10cb8760f7011796a6edf7a268061       100.000.000 of Tokens
ERC20: 0xEC73A0F098073C4F43E393B9B2f36073a0484401       100.000.000 of Tokens

Security Token:
Our Security Token $GMSOCIOS represents rights to the profits of the holding. 
A percentage of the profits from each company within the holding will contribute to collateralizing 
the token in a Smart Contract that accumulates USDT as liquidity for $GMS.

Tokenomic: 
Max Supply: 500.000 $GMSOCIOS
60% To Sell
40% Hold

BEP20: 0x4F8bE821F36dbFf8065E893404065BcdFd1C100A

This is a private asset that will remain outside the speculative market and will increase in value based on the amount of USDT backing it.


Target Market: 
Our niche is very broad as we provide services to all types of companies. Additionally, 
once the offerings are launched in the market, we target all small, medium, and large 
crypto and traditional investors worldwide.

1. Companies that are already generating revenue and need liquidity for their operations
2. Brokers, investment institutions, small, medium, and large investors in both the crypto and traditional markets


Biopreference Ally:
Zero Thermal™ (ZT) is an organic polymer and technology derived from extracts of brown seaweeds, red and green algae that 
are mainly polysaccharides, phlorotannin’s, proteins, and nucleic acids. Polymers show various biological activities in both 
plant and animal systems and are involved in host defense mechanisms. There is interest in agriculture in polymers that elicit defensive 
responses resulting in protection against pathogens or insect damage. Pathogen suppression can also occur with a high degree of confidence 
through indirect inhibition. By converting the iron in soil into a chelating agent that manipulates the iron so that it becomes 
unavailable to pathogenic fungi and allows certain native bacteria that have a positive effect on plant growth to grow under iron-limiting conditions.

20% of Zero Thermal's profits are added to the capitalization of the $ZT Token, increasing liquidity in USDT as collateral.

BRUNO: 
My role as CEO of GM has not been easy; I have had to mature my thoughts and decision-making. 
I have faced significant challenges such as the legal and tax aspects, learning how to navigate 
the uncharted path of building Web3. In the last 8 years, I have dedicated my days and energy to constructing 
a methodology based on my experience with GM Token, learning from mistakes and losses that taught me to create new MM (Market Making) 
strategies for the Security tokens representing companies in the global crypto market. My dream is centered around economic activation 
in the Latin American region, allowing people worldwide to become liquidity aggregators in real and expanding businesses.

We are achieving it; we are training ourselves every day to understand how the tools work that allow us to grow and expand our vision.


And what if we all come together to restore purpose to money? What if we change the rules of the economic game? What if we open the doors to people who never had access?
